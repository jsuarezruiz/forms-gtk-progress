Effects, Platforms Specifics, or Forms Embedding are supported options.

**Can I extend functionality to new platforms by creating new controls?**

Absolutely! You can create effects or custom renders in the same way as iOS or Android.

**What has been used with the WebView control?**

Internally the browser control makes use of [webkit-sharp](https://github.com/mono/webkit-sharp).

Internally the Map control makes use of [GMaps.NET](https://github.com/radioman/greatmaps).

**How can I use all this today?**

Is recommended reading the [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md) section. Basically, you need to sync and compile the repository to access to the `Xamarin.Forms.Platforms.GTK.dll` library.

**How do I make the WebView work?**

The Xamarin.Forms GTK backend makes use of [webkit-sharp](https://github.com/mono/webkit-sharp). If you do not have it installed, you must install `libwebkit-dev package`:

    sudo apt-get install libwebkitgtk-dev

**I have tried the backend, in Linux I have problems to perform http requests. What can I do?**

You would need to install trusted roots certificate from Mozilla as below: 

    sudo mozroots --import --ask-remove --machine

**How will I use the Xamarin.Forms GTK Backend in the future?**

Like the rest of platforms. Using NuGet packages and project templates.
